      <h2>Prototype and production distinction</h2>
      <p>
        The interactive demo uses sample data and local browser state. Production accounts may
        process profile, business, transaction, customer, receipt, subscription and support
        information after backend configuration and launch approval.
      </p>

      <h2>Registration information</h2>
      <p>
        Registration may collect a legal name, Ethiopian mobile number, email address, region, city
        or woreda, preferred language, business role and identity-document type. During
        registration, Biloo Mezgeb retains only the final four characters of the identity number.
        The complete document number is used for client-side format validation and is not sent to or
        stored in the Biloo Mezgeb database.
      </p>

      <h2>Identity verification status</h2>
      <p>
        Providing an identity type and final four characters does not mean that the identity has
        been verified. Accounts remain marked unverified until Biloo Mezgeb connects an approved
        verification provider and completes the required consent, security and legal review.
      </p>

      <h2>Purposes</h2>
      <p>
        Information is used to operate the ledger, provide authentication, localize the account,
        prevent abuse, manage plan access, generate reports, support users and meet legal
        obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention and deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Users may request deletion. Financial records may require legally permitted retention.
        Identity fragments should be deleted or anonymized when no longer required for their stated
        purpose, subject to applicable legal obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Use the repository security channel or the official support contact configured for
        production.
